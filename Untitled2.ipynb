    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances) that share common attributes and behaviors. It defines the structure and behavior of objects of a certain type. A class serves as a template or a prototype from which objects are created. It encapsulates data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.\n",

    "An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class blueprint. Objects have their own unique state (values for their attributes) and behavior (methods). They can interact with other objects and perform tasks based on the behavior defined in the class.\n",

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It allows for the hiding of the internal state of an object and restricting access to certain parts of the code. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and information hiding, which improves code maintainability and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of an object and only showing the necessary features to the outside world. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction helps in simplifying the programming model, making it easier to understand and work with complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class (subclass or derived class) can inherit properties (attributes and methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. Subclasses can extend or modify the behavior of the superclass, enabling the creation of more specialized classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows a single interface to be used for objects of different types, enabling code to be more generic and flexible. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method defined in its superclass) and method overloading (where multiple methods with the same name but different parameters are defined within a class).\n",

    "The __init__() function, also known as the constructor, is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when a new object of that class is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object and perform any necessary setup operations. The __init__() method is typically used to set initial values for the object's attributes based on the arguments provided during object creation.\n",

    "Here's why the __init__() function is used:\n",

    "Initialization: It allows you to initialize the state (attributes) of newly created objects. You can set default values for attributes or accept arguments to customize the initial state of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute Assignment: It provides a convenient way to assign values to the attributes of the object during object creation, ensuring that the object is in a valid state from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Clarity and Maintainability: By centralizing the initialization logic in the __init__() method, you make the code easier to read, understand, and maintain. It helps in organizing the initialization process and makes it clear what actions are taken when an object is created.\n",
